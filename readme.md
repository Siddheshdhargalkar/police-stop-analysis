# Police Stop Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a police stop dataset, which includes detailed records of traffic stops conducted by law enforcement. The dataset captures various attributes such as driver demographics, types of violations, outcomes of searches, and other contextual factors.

The primary goal of this project is to explore the dataset through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, enabling the identification of patterns and trends related to traffic stops.

## Prerequisites

To run the analysis locally, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Structure

- **Notebook (`Police_Data_Analysis.ipynb`)**  
  Contains the full data analysis workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.

- **Dataset**  
  The raw police stop data used for the analysis (dataset file not included in this repositoryâ€”please add it to the working directory before running the notebook).

## Key Insights

- **Demographic Analysis:**  
  Examines how driver characteristics (age, gender, etc.) correlate with stop outcomes.

- **Violation and Outcome Trends:**  
  Identifies common types of violations and their associated outcomes, including search rates and arrest likelihood.

- **Visualization of Findings:**  
  Presents trends and relationships using clear and informative charts such as bar graphs, histograms, and heatmaps.

## Results Summary

The analysis reveals meaningful correlations between various factors involved in police stops. Key findings include patterns based on driver demographics, variation in outcomes by violation type, and insights into potential disparities. These results can inform further research or policy discussions regarding law enforcement practices.
